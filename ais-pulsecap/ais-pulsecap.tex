\section{Introduction}

Applied Ion Systems (AIS) requested a failure analysis of a Kemet C4540H683KGGWCT050 pulse capacitor, which had failed
catastrophically (Fig. \ref{failure}) during maximum-power (2 kV) test firing of a prototype AIS-gPPT3-1C-T pulsed
plasma thruster.

Antikernel Labs performed a best-effort analysis at no cost in order to support the open-hardware nature of AIS's work.

\section{Specimen Overview}

Two Kemet C4540H683KGGWCT050 capacitors were provided by AIS: the failed part, as well as an identical undamaged
capacitor (Fig. \ref{overview}) removed from the failed board to be used for process development and testing.

The capacitor is a 11.4 x 10.2 x 2.7 mm multi-layer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) using C0G-type dielectric, with a nominal
capacitance of 68 nF and a 2 kV maximum voltage rating. It is intended for high voltage pulsed discharge applications.

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Overview}

Preliminary optical imaging of the failed side of the capacitor (Fig. \ref{fail-overview}, Fig. \ref{fail-closeup})
showed a cratered region with long cracks radiating lengthwise down the capacitor body.

\subsection{Initial Sectioning}

The large size of the capacitor presented some unique challenges for analysis, since it was too large to fit edgewise
into most standard embedding molds.

Experimentation with using power tools to cut down the test capacitor led to excessive cracking, so bulk material
removal on the failed specimen was performed by hand sanding using P150 and P220 $Al_2O_3$ sandpaper.

The sample was embedded in epoxy resin (AA-Bond F110, Atom Adhesives, Fig.\ref{section-overview}) and ground with P220
$Al_2O_3$ sandpaper until the solder and copper terminal were removed. A preliminary cross section immediately past the
terminal surface (slightly to the left of the green bar in Fig. \ref{section-plane}) was polished with P500, P1200,
P2000, P3000, P5000, P8000, and P10000 $SiC$ sandpaper, then lapped with 300 nm $Al_2O_3$ to produce an optically flat
surface

This section showed a stack of 64 plates (Fig. \ref{section-plates}) with a total thickness of $1610 \mu m$, separated
from the top and bottom component faces by $355 \mu m$ of ceramic shell. Shell thickness from the edges of the plate
stack to the sides of the capacitor was $245 \mu m$.

Plates were approximately $1.4 \mu m$ thick, separated by $25 \mu m$ of the C0G dielectric. Since this section was
taken immediately adjacent to a terminal, only plates connecting to this terminal were visible. The core of the
capacitor presumably contains 128 plates at approximately $11.8 \mu m$ spacing.

Numerous cracks in the dielectric (Fig. \ref{cracks1}, Fig. \ref{cracks2}) were visible on the side of the capacitor
closest to the failure site. These are likely the result of thermal stress during overheating at the moment of failure.
